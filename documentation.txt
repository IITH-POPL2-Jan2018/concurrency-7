Tutorial 18:

Going to seperate the game engine from the game.

Initializing windows through game engine (ArrowsIoEngine)

OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications

We are making a camera class to replicate how we can move a camera around a graphic object.

We are using the translate function to move the viewport. Now sprites can be created using world coordinates instead of normailzed coordinates.

Did camera translation and scaling.		

Tutorial 22 Pt-1:

Batch multiple sprites in one draw call (Instead of having a seperate vbo for each sprite).
Made spriteBatch class to handle multiple sprites in one draw call.
We are sorting glyphs based on their TEXTURE.

We will store Glyphs with same texture in same batch. If we find any Glyph with new texture, then add it to render batch.
